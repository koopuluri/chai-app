# chaiapp (Connecting people by interest and location).

## Major functions in this app:

- Login / Signup (uses Facebook login).
- View “Meets” around you: a meet is an event with a name, description, location, time, host, max number of participants, and members. A user can see meets around them, click on a meet and view its details, and join it if they want to. 
- Chat with members of a joined meet. Oftentimes it’s intimidating to meet a bunch of strangers without knowing anything about them. A profile system along with the ability to chat with members before actually going were meant to offset potential sketchness. 
- Host a meet at a location.
